John McCarthy was an American computer and cognitive scientist. McCarthy was one of the founders of the discipline of artificial intelligence. He coined the term “Artificial Intelligence,” invented the first programming language for symbolic computation, LISP (which is still used as a preferred language in the field of AI), and invented and established time-sharing. Human-level AI and commonsense reasoning were two of his major contributions.

This reposity is created for the demystification of various aspects, concepts, theories, technologies, techniques and use cases which is required for the basic or Deep understanding of the AI and ML.
